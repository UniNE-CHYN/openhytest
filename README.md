# openhytest
Open source package for well test analysis, inspired by the functionalities available in hytool.

openhytest is currently structured into three modules:
- Pre-processing functions and utilities handling data preparation
- A library of flow models and analytic solutions, following an oriented-object programming structure
- Post-processing functions for results analysis, statistical summary and reporting.

Analytic solutions for tracer tests may be added in the future.
