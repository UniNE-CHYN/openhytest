# openhytest
Open source python package for hydraulic testing interpretation

This package is in a very early state project. 

The general idea is to create an environment for hydraulic test interpretation using novel tools available in python and be inspired by some of the functionalities available in hytool.

The package should contain three key components:
- a data handling and managing part for time series based on pandas
- a model part that could be consist in a series of classes that would inherit some generic features from a generic model class
- an interpretation part that would contain the description of any test, the data, and the model used for the interpretaion.

More will come.
